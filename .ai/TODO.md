# TODO

Updated: 2026-08-13

This is the working list, not a history. What was done in Phase 1 lives in git history, `.ai/DECISIONS.md` and the summary in `.ai/CURRENT.md`.

## NOW — Implementation Phase 2

Follow the private task breakdown:
`nikotaronosuke/ai-problem-solving-memory-spec/docs/implementation/phase2-task-breakdown.md`

Implementation Phase 1 is complete. All fourteen tasks are done and its Definition of Done was verified item by item.

### P2-01 — DONE
API application foundation.

Fastify 5 transport in `src/http/`, application services in `src/app/`, `/v1` versioning with `/health` outside it, one error envelope, owner-scoped authenticated request context, redacted logging, and a composition root that owns the pool, the listener and shutdown.

Definition of Done verified: `/health` and `/v1/me` work, invalid input returns a consistent `INVALID_REQUEST` envelope, and the transport layer imports neither `pg` nor `src/db/` — enforced by `tests/architecture.test.ts`, not convention.

### P2-02 — DONE
Project / Environment API.

Seven routes in the authenticated `/v1` scope: Project create, get, list and partial update; Environment create, get and list. Environments are nested under their project for create and list. No delete, and no Environment update.

Definition of Done verified against a real database: an owner creates, reads, lists and patches its own projects and environments; another owner gets 404 for each of read, patch, environment-create and environment-list, with a body identical to a resource that does not exist; patching an unknown id creates nothing; and transport reaches storage only through the application service, enforced by the architecture test.

Repository grew from ten operations to thirteen: `listProjects`, `updateProject`, `listEnvironments`.

### P2-03 — DONE
Problem create / get / list / partial update API.

Four routes: `POST|GET /v1/projects/:project_id/problems` and `GET|PATCH /v1/problems/:problem_id`. No delete, and no unscoped `/v1/problems` collection.

Definition of Done verified against a real database: an owner creates, reads, lists and patches its own problems; another owner gets 404 for read, patch and list, with a body identical to a resource that does not exist; patching an unknown id creates nothing; and every error uses the shared envelope.

Which fields a caller may set was decided here (D-054, D-055). A new Problem's starting state comes from the column defaults, and a patch may change eleven fields — `status`, `fix_kind` and `version` are not among them, because they belong to P2-06, P2-12 and P2-07 respectively. Sending one is a 400 rather than an ignored field.

Repository grew from thirteen operations to fifteen: `listProblems`, `updateProblem`.

### P2-04 — DONE
Event append / list API.

Two routes: `POST|GET /v1/problems/:problem_id/events`. No single-event read, no update, no delete.

Definition of Done verified against a real database: the same `client_event_id` sent again does not produce a second event, and a `HYPOTHESIS → ATTEMPT → DEAD_END → DISCOVERY → FIX` history appends and reads back in order.

The open question D-027 left is now settled (D-058): a retry returns the original event with the same 201 and the same body, the first write wins even if the retry's payload differs, and the key is the owner's rather than the problem's. The race is arbitrated by the unique index rather than by a read-then-write, and the concurrency test was confirmed to fail against the naive version before being kept.

Repository operations unchanged at fifteen — `appendEvent` and `listEvents` already existed.

### P2-05 — DONE
Verification append / list API.

Two routes: `POST|GET /v1/problems/:problem_id/verifications`. No single-verification read, no update, no delete, and no route reaching one through an Event.

Definition of Done verified against a real database: a FIX Event and a Verification are stored and read back as separate things, and successful and failed checks are distinguishable — `result` is a boolean at the HTTP boundary as well as in storage, with `null`, `"true"`, `1` and a missing field all refused rather than coerced.

The question D-060 deferred is now answered (D-063): a Verification retry replays the original and cannot change what the check found, in either direction. `DuplicateClientEventIdError` had no remaining thrower once both paths replayed, so it was removed rather than kept (D-064). Recording a successful Verification still leaves the Problem's status untouched (D-065).

Repository operations unchanged at fifteen — `appendVerification` and `listVerifications` already existed.

### P2-06 — DONE
Problem state transition service.

One route: `POST /v1/problems/:problem_id/status-transitions`, taking only `target_status`. It is the only way a status changes — the Problem PATCH still refuses `status`, and no append moves it.

Definition of Done verified against a real database: `VERIFIED` is unreachable without a successful Verification of the Problem's own, every move outside the matrix is refused, and a paused Problem resumes as either working status.

The rule itself is `src/domain/problem-status.ts` — plain data and plain functions, no HTTP, no storage. All 25 status pairs are checked against a matrix written out independently of the implementation, so an added or removed move is visible. The architecture test now also forbids a status literal anywhere in `src/` outside the domain.

A transition changes the status and nothing else: `fix_kind`, `confidence`, the flags and `version` all stay put, and a refusal writes nothing at all (D-069).

Repository grew from fifteen operations to sixteen: `updateProblemStatus`, deliberately separate from `updateProblem` whose input still has no status field.

### P2-07 — DONE
Optimistic locking on Problem.

`expected_version` is required on both Problem write paths — the ordinary PATCH and the status transition — and both increment the version on success and share the one column, so an edit and a transition conflict with each other rather than passing unseen.

Definition of Done verified against a real database: two writes from the same version leave one 200 and one 409, and Event and Verification appends keep working independently of the Problem's version. The three racing tests were confirmed to fail against a read-then-write first, where all three produce two 200s and a lost update.

`VERSION_CONFLICT` is a fifth error code at 409, naming no version (D-074). Ownership is settled before the version, and the version before the transition rule (D-075).

Events and Verifications are deliberately not versioned: their retry protection is `client_event_id`, which answers a different question (D-072).

Repository operations unchanged at sixteen — both write signatures gained `expectedVersion` rather than a new operation appearing.

### P2-08 — NEXT
Relation entity / API.

Depends on P2-03, satisfied. See the private task breakdown for its Definition of Done. Nothing exists yet: no table, no migration, no domain type — so unlike P2-04 through P2-07 this one starts at the schema rather than at the API.

Note that Relations cross Problems, which every rule so far has been careful to keep separate: evidence is per Problem (D-068), and the owner check is what makes a cross-Problem reference safe. A relation to another owner's Problem must not be creatable, and must not be able to reveal that one exists.

## BLOCKED

None currently documented.

## SETTLED — local stack network exposure

Docker publishes the local Supabase ports on all interfaces, not only loopback. Enabling fewer services reduced the published ports to three, but the binding address is a Docker daemon setting, not a repository one.

Decided: not a blocker. The Docker daemon configuration is left unchanged, and the operating rule is to stop the local stack when it is not in use (`npm run supabase:stop`). Revisit only if the stack ever needs to run on an untrusted network.

## LATER

P2-02 onward follow the private Phase 2 breakdown. Phases 3–9 follow the roadmap in the private specification repository. Do not begin a later phase before the current one's Definition of Done is satisfied unless the specification is deliberately revised.
