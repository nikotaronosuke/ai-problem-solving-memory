# TODO

Updated: 2026-08-13

This is the working list, not a history. What was done in Phase 1 lives in git history, `.ai/DECISIONS.md` and the summary in `.ai/CURRENT.md`.

## NOW — Implementation Phase 2

Follow the private task breakdown:
`nikotaronosuke/ai-problem-solving-memory-spec/docs/implementation/phase2-task-breakdown.md`

Implementation Phase 1 is complete. All fourteen tasks are done and its Definition of Done was verified item by item.

### P2-01 — DONE
API application foundation.

Fastify 5 transport in `src/http/`, application services in `src/app/`, `/v1` versioning with `/health` outside it, one error envelope, owner-scoped authenticated request context, redacted logging, and a composition root that owns the pool, the listener and shutdown.

Definition of Done verified: `/health` and `/v1/me` work, invalid input returns a consistent `INVALID_REQUEST` envelope, and the transport layer imports neither `pg` nor `src/db/` — enforced by `tests/architecture.test.ts`, not convention.

### P2-02 — DONE
Project / Environment API.

Seven routes in the authenticated `/v1` scope: Project create, get, list and partial update; Environment create, get and list. Environments are nested under their project for create and list. No delete, and no Environment update.

Definition of Done verified against a real database: an owner creates, reads, lists and patches its own projects and environments; another owner gets 404 for each of read, patch, environment-create and environment-list, with a body identical to a resource that does not exist; patching an unknown id creates nothing; and transport reaches storage only through the application service, enforced by the architecture test.

Repository grew from ten operations to thirteen: `listProjects`, `updateProject`, `listEnvironments`.

### P2-03 — DONE
Problem create / get / list / partial update API.

Four routes: `POST|GET /v1/projects/:project_id/problems` and `GET|PATCH /v1/problems/:problem_id`. No delete, and no unscoped `/v1/problems` collection.

Definition of Done verified against a real database: an owner creates, reads, lists and patches its own problems; another owner gets 404 for read, patch and list, with a body identical to a resource that does not exist; patching an unknown id creates nothing; and every error uses the shared envelope.

Which fields a caller may set was decided here (D-054, D-055). A new Problem's starting state comes from the column defaults, and a patch may change eleven fields — `status`, `fix_kind` and `version` are not among them, because they belong to P2-06, P2-12 and P2-07 respectively. Sending one is a 400 rather than an ignored field.

Repository grew from thirteen operations to fifteen: `listProblems`, `updateProblem`.

### P2-04 — NEXT
Event API.

Depends on P2-03, which is satisfied. See the private task breakdown for its Definition of Done. Note what is still deliberately absent: a duplicate `client_event_id` is currently refused, not replayed, and returning the original is this task's decision to make.

## BLOCKED

None currently documented.

## SETTLED — local stack network exposure

Docker publishes the local Supabase ports on all interfaces, not only loopback. Enabling fewer services reduced the published ports to three, but the binding address is a Docker daemon setting, not a repository one.

Decided: not a blocker. The Docker daemon configuration is left unchanged, and the operating rule is to stop the local stack when it is not in use (`npm run supabase:stop`). Revisit only if the stack ever needs to run on an untrusted network.

## LATER

P2-02 onward follow the private Phase 2 breakdown. Phases 3–9 follow the roadmap in the private specification repository. Do not begin a later phase before the current one's Definition of Done is satisfied unless the specification is deliberately revised.
